Takeaway Java Assignment

This REST API is designed to act as a server part of the "Game of Three" game.

Implemented using Java 8 and Spring Boot 2.

Application run via the following command: ./mvnw spring-boot:run

End-points served by this API can be easly watched by navigating following url: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

Note that I spent approximately 1.5 days to create this project, although I didn't manage to complete all functional requirements of the project by your deadline.
 
Improvements areas: 
 - Client side development
 - Code coverage 
 - Documentation
 - Implementation doesn't comply with DDD
